# Miro3D

Miro 3D is an application plugin for Miro.com which allows 3d objects to be loaded as gltf or glb files.

Miro is a multi-user digital collaberative artboard allowing teams to plan and create 'the next big thing'.
The current toolset only supports 2d objects and we believe this is restricting, by adding 3 dimensional functionality we allow more complex ideas to be conveyed in an easier to understand and less messy way.
